# System Goal
The triangle optimizer is a hill climber intended to allow for approximation of .bmp files using iterative addition of semi-transparent geometric primitives.

# C++ implementation 
As a baseline a pure C++ implementation is created, benchmarked and optimized.

This system picks a random triangle, optimizes it to reduce the MSE between the target image and the candidate image.


# CLI definition
The tool will be called using a CLI and controlled with a config.yaml file which will allow for different parameters and tests to be completed.

```
./triopt <target.png> <output.png> [iterations] [seed] [patience]
